# Advent of Code CLI

`aocli` is a CLI client for advent of code.

The purpose of this tool is so you don't have to leave your editor while participating (if you are lazy like me) or if you want to save seconds if you are trying to be competitive.

Please do not use this tool for automated AI assisted submissions. This is actively [discouraged by the AoC team](https://adventofcode.com/about#faq_ai_leaderboard) and against the spirit of AoC.

## Features

- Load Advent of Code session cookie from a file or environment variable.
- Read puzzle description and save it to a file in Markdown format.
- Download puzzle input.
- Submit your puzzle answer and check if it is correct.
- Validate arguments (year, day, puzzle part) and check if puzzle is unlocked.
- If year is not provided, default to the current or last Advent of Code event.
- Infer puzzle day when possible (last unlocked puzzle for current and past events).
