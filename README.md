# Advent of Code CLI
`aocli` is a CLI client for advent of code.
The purpose of this tool is so you don't have to leave your editor while participating (if you are lazy like me) or if you want to save seconds if you are trying to be competitive.
Please do not use this tool for automated AI assisted submissions. This is actively [discouraged by the AoC team](https://adventofcode.com/about#faq_ai_leaderboard) and against the spirit of AoC.
